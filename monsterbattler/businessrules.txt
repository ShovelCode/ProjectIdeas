Inspired from the Pokemon battle simulators from mIRC bots, NetBattle, Shoddybattle, PokemonOnline, and Pokemon Showdown.

An interface that looks similar to the computer card game Hearthstone.

Players bring a set of 16 units, and take turns building their team. The first player choose one of their 16, and other player then chooses one,
and so forth until a set of 8 have been chosen.

All 8 of those have 6 moves.

the units can be one, two, or three of 24 types

each move has a type and one of three categories related to the attack, defense, and speed of the 9 stats.

the type chart about weakness and resistance chart is symmetric

reduced or no RNG or lack of perfect information.

9 stats, three attacks, 3 defenses, and 3 speeds

stats and damage values kept to less than 24 for easy calculation. These can be represented by integer value types.

names of the units are generated, probably from the Japanese syllables since they fit together so well
